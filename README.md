# vizzy
This is 	Vizzy's "oh so amazing" repository!

This repository contains the necessary tools to interact with Vizzy - both on simulation and real robot usage.

The real robot uses two different middlewares for distinct body parts (YARP for the upperbody and ROS for the mobile base). In simulation there are two options in terms of middleware - one aligned with the real robot (using YARP and ROS) and one aiming simulation experiences (using exclusively ROS).
